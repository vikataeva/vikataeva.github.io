        <h3>My hobbies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Graphic Design</li>
            <p> Graphic design in my greatest passion and I want to turn it into my profession someday. (Hopefully soon)</p>
            <li>Photography</li>
            <p> I love photography because of its ability to capture special moments that will forever remind you of the past.</p>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <p> I love painting because it allows me to express my emotions and thoughts in a visual way. It's just like graphic design but more intimate as you are directly working with the medium, you cant copy paste or undo something. Every decision, every mistake becomes part of the final artwork.</p>

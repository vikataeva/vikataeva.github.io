              <h3>Made in Russia</h3>
              <p>
                I was born on a remote, windswept island in the Far East of Russia called Sakhalin. It was there,
                surrounded by the quiet beauty of nature and the rhythm of island life, that I spent the first fifteen
                years of my life. Those early years left an indelible mark on me—they were the beginning of everything.
                It was on that island that I first fell in love with the arts. Since childhood, I found solace in drawing
                and painting, and slowly, a deep fascination with directing and cinematography began to take root in my heart.

            <h3>Moving to Canada</h3>
            <p> When I was 15, life offered me a remarkable opportunity—I moved across the world to study in Edmonton, Canada. For three transformative years, I called it home while attending Lillian Osborne High School. It was there that my artistic journey began to take on new meaning. Surrounded by new faces, experiences, and inspirations, I started to take my passion for art more seriously. I still remember the feeling of pride and vulnerability during my very first art exhibition—it was a moment that changed everything. From then on, I knew in my heart that the arts weren’t just a passion—they were my path.</p>

            <h3> Vancouver and Film</h3>
            <p> After high school, my heart longed to become an artist—but the path felt uncertain, fragile in the eyes of practicality. So I turned to another love that had always stirred something deep within me: film. With hope and determination, I moved to Vancouver and enrolled in the Foundations of Visual Art and Design program at Vancouver Film School. It was a beautiful, immersive experience that only deepened my passion for storytelling through film. But just as I was finding my footing, the world shifted—Covid struck, and with it came challenges I hadn’t anticipated. Opportunities in the film industry became scarce, and finding work felt like chasing something just out of reach. Yet even through the uncertainty, my love for the craft never wavered—it only grew stronger.</p>
            <div class="text-column">
            <h3> From Film back to Arts</h3>
            <p>As an international student, I was faced with a difficult reality: in order to stay in Canada, I had to either find work or return to school. With job opportunities in the film industry scarce, I made the decision to continue my education and pursue film studies at the University of British Columbia. At first, it felt like the right step—but over time, something didn’t sit right. I wasn’t finding joy in the program, and a few disheartening experiences within the film industry made me pause and reflect.

                It became clear to me that while I still deeply loved film as an art form, I didn’t feel the same way about the industry surrounding it. That realization was both difficult and freeing. I chose to listen to my heart and transferred from Film Production to a Visual Art major. In doing so, I returned to the things that had always brought me peace and fulfillment—drawing, painting, and visual design.
                
                It was during this period of rediscovery that a new spark was lit within me: I began to fall in love with digital arts. What started as a shift became a transformation—one that reconnected me with my creativity in a way that felt deeply authentic.</p>

                <h3> Relocation with Determination</h3>
                <p>After three years of studying Visual Arts at UBC, I was faced with a difficult turning point: a significant financial challenge that forced me to pause my studies. It was heartbreaking to step away from something I loved, but during that time of uncertainty, a quiet clarity began to form within me. I started to realize that perhaps what I needed wasn’t just to follow my passion, but to find a path that could blend my love for art with a career that offered stability and growth—something that would allow me to continue building a life in Canada.

                    With a hopeful heart, I made the decision to move back to Alberta—this time to Calgary. Here, I began a new chapter, enrolling in the Graphic Design program at SAIT. I'm just finishing up my first semester, but already, it feels right. I’m genuinely enjoying the program, and for the first time in a long while, I feel both creatively fulfilled and confident in the direction I’ve chosen.
                    
                    Where this path will lead me, I’m not entirely sure—but I do know one thing: I’m determined to pursue my passion for graphic design with everything I have.</p>
